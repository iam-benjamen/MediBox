## Introduction

MediBox is an **automated medicine dispensing and health monitoring system** developed as a final-year project in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Ibadan, Nigeria by [Areo Benjamen](https:linkedin.com/in/areo-benjamen) & [Ajiboye Ajibola](https:linkedin.com/in/areo-benjamen) under the supervision of [Dr. K.O Odeyemi](https:linkedin.com/in/areo-benjamen).

The system is designed to improve medication adherence by alerting users when their medication is due, dispensing the correct dosage, and monitoring key health parameters.

MediBox aims to enhance patient care, particularly for individuals with chronic illnesses or those requiring strict medication schedules.  

## Problem Statement

In contemporary healthcare, medication non-adherence remains a significant challenge, particularly among the elderly and individuals with chronic illnesses. The World Health Organization reports that nearly 50% of patients with chronic diseases do not adhere to their prescribed medication regimens, leading to severe health complications and increased healthcare costs (WHO, 2021). This issue not only jeopardizes patient health outcomes but also strains healthcare systems, with medication non-adherence costing the U.S. healthcare system an estimated $290 billion annually (New England Healthcare Institute, 2009).

## Objectives

The objectives of this project are to:

- design, 3D-print, and laser-cut the models of the physical components of the medicine dispenser which contains medicine containers, tubes, solenoid holders, and other casings;

- interface the mechanical components with the electronic unit (microcontroller & power source) to dispense the medicine containers at scheduled times;

- integrate the health monitoring sensors into the microcontroller; and
- develop a web-based software platform for remote data monitoring and sync with the microcontroller via Wifi.
